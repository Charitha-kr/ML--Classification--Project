## 📘 **Is the Person Eligible to Get the Job?** – ML Classification Project

---

### 🧠 Overview

This machine learning project aims to predict whether a person is eligible for a specific job role based on various personal, academic, and behavioral attributes. It uses classification algorithms to analyze historical data and generate predictions.

---

### ✅ Problem Statement

In today's competitive job market, organizations receive hundreds of applications for a single role. Screening all candidates manually is inefficient. This project offers an AI-based system to **automatically classify whether a candidate is eligible for the job**, based on features like:

* Academic performance
* Work environment preference
* Career motivation
* Leadership experience
* Tech-savviness

---

### 📂 Dataset

**Source**: Self-collected or survey-based dataset
**File**: `cleaned_final.csv`

#### 🎯 Target Column:

* `"What would you like to become when you grow up"` *(classified into roles like Freelancer, Government Officer, Entrepreneur, etc.)*

#### 📊 Key Features Used:

* `Preferred Work Environment`
* `Academic Performance (CGPA/Percentage)`
* `Motivation for Career Choice`
* `Leadership Experience`
* `Tech-Savviness`

---

### 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Cleaned and standardized all values (e.g., CGPA → percentages)
* Removed null or irrelevant fields
* Encoded categorical data using `LabelEncoder`
* Scaled numerical features using `StandardScaler`

---

### 🛠️ ML Models Implemented

* **Random Forest Classifier**
* **XGBoost Classifier** (with hyperparameter tuning)

🧪 **Evaluation Metrics**:

* Accuracy
* Precision, Recall, F1-score
* Confusion Matrix

---

### 🧑‍💻 Tech Stack

* Python 🐍
* pandas, numpy
* scikit-learn
* xgboost
* matplotlib, seaborn
* Streamlit (for UI, optional)

---

### 🎯 Model Performance

| Model           | Accuracy | Best Use Case                  |
| --------------- | -------- | ------------------------------ |
| Random Forest   | \~37%    | Baseline non-linear classifier |
| XGBoost (tuned) | \~51%    | Best performing classifier     |

*Note: Class imbalance and subjective career aspirations make this a challenging real-world problem.*
